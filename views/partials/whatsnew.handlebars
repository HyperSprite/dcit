 -  Introduced the “model” concept. Since System and Equipment ticket numbers are not limited to a single number, adding “model” to a System or Equipment that is the gold standard for that type makes it easy to replicate later. Obviously, as standards change, models need to change with them, the model tag can be added or removed at any time.

 -  Fixed the Port Configs so they no longer have a leading 0 for ports below 10.
        See example here [con-loc01-103c-01](endpoint/con-loc01-103c-01) in the sample site.
####v0.1.05
 - Added ILOM config for Oracle x4-2 Equipment. To make this work:
        1.  You need to pick NetMgmt as the port type.
        2.  Use “ilom” for the port name so it appends it to the host name in the config
 - Here is an example of a System with a ilom config [webfront1001](system/webfront1001)
####v0.1.04
