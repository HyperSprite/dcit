<li>Introduced the “model” concept. Since System and Equipment ticket numbers are not limited to a single number, adding “model” to a System or Equipment that is the gold standard for that type makes it easy to replicate later.

</ul>

<li>Added ILOM config for Oracle x4-2 Equipment. To make this work:
<ol>
<li>You need to pick NetMgmt as the port type.</li>
<li>Use “ilom” for the port name so it appends it to the host name in the config</li>
</ol>
<li>Here is an example of a System with a ilom config <a href="system/jms100-sp1">jms100-sp1</a></li>
</li>
</ul>
<li>v0.1.04</li>
<ul>

</ul>
